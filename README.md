Pseudo 3d Game Engine

An experiment into rendering 3d Monster Maze style mazes on Agon Light, using z80 Assembler.

Uses screen  mode 136 for flicker-free updates.

Keys:
UP - forward
LEFT - spin left
RIGHT - spin right
ESC - exit

Collect as many coins as you can find in the maze.


NOTE: requires VDP v 2.7.3 or above for walls to be rendered using 'filled path' VDP plot command.
